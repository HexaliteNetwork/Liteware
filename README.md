## Credits

Liteware is built from scratch with the help of many people and a few resources. Without these resources probably this project
wouldn't even exist; this list include:

1. [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), obviously;
2. 🗨️ PowerNukkit community in Discord;
3. 🐈 CloudburstMC/Protocol;
4. 🐈 CloudburstMC/Network;
5. 🐈 JRakNet/JRakNet;
6. And many other open source libraries in which you can find in `licenses/third_party_licenses` or in the build scripts.
